#### Big idea : A hot dense beginning

##### Can we see this fiery beginning?
We can almost see the beginning. 380,000 years after the big bang at T1. Everywhere was filled with dense hot matter with tiny fluctuations

Everyone's observable universe is centred on themselves. (13.7 billion years either way)

So, looking at the edge (13.7 billion years) we can assume that our location was at the same state.

__Inflation theory__: Early on, our universe (big volume of space) was really tiny (smaller than nucleus of atom) but something happened that caused space to expand really rapidly

The tiny fluctuations were expanded to a cosmic size, and turned into gigantic fluctuations that form different gravity zones (e.g. blue less-dense zones formed higher gravity zones that created suns). So, we come from quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

##### Why something rather than nothing?

**Quantum**: Spontaneous creation; something from nothing - briefly!


**Gravity**: Negative energy of gravity + positive energy of matter = 0?
Energy is positive, but gravity is negative. So, from a fundamental perspective, the net energy of the universe could be 0.

According to Einstein, blackholes are black and nothing can come out. According to Hawking, black holes in a quantum context are not black but have a glow.

_Was_ there a beginning?
How did the universe get into the hot dense state 13.7 billion years ago?

_How_ can the universe exist at all?
In order to understand how atoms exist (without exploding like an atomic bomb), we have to understand how space and time works with quantum theory.


# The Sky

#### Naked eye astronomy
- Stars and constellations (88 different ones) / "asterisms"
- Rotation of the earth and "sky coordinates"
- Phases of the moon
- The ecliptic: path of sun and planets in the sky
- Seasons
- Time

#### Main point: Motions appear complex because:
1. Motions are not all circular
2. Motions are not all in the same plane
3. We are on the earth, spinning and moving

### Motions in the sky
Rotation of the earth causes apparent rotation of the sky. So constellations appear in different places.

At the equator, the stars make almost straight lines on a long exposure.

### Location on the sky
__Right Ascension__: Like longitude on celestial sphere (measured in hours with respect to spring equinox)

__Declination__: Like latitude on celestial sphere (measured in degrees above celestial equator)

We use Declination and Ascension to locate items in the sky

_Example:_

How high in "your" sky will an object be?
- We are at a latitude of 44 degrees. On 21 Dec the Sun is at a Declination of -23.5 degrees. (Would be seen directly overhead at noon at latitude of -23.5 degrees).
- How high in the sky (altitude) is the sun at noon?

		180 - (44 + 23.5 + 90) = 22.5 degrees

### Seperation of objects on the sky

- Angular Seperation:
	- Measured in degrees, arc (minutes), arc (seconds)
