# Motion, Gravity and Conservation Laws

## Newton's 1st Law of Motion (Inertia)
If total forces is 0, then there is no change in velocity.

#### Big idea: Always falling... but never falls down
For moon, there is a sideways drift, and falling towards the earth. The result is that the moon orbits the earth.

Moon is travelling at 1022m/s (horizontally)
But, moon is falling.

How far does the moon fall in one second?
Pythagoras - Use a right triangle to find result
