#### Other orbital properties

`e` (eccentricity) - Higher the number, the more elliptical the orbit is.
- Mercury has a very elliptical orbit, followed by mars.
- The elliptical orbit of mars helped kepler realize that orbits are not perfect circles

#### Physical Properties
Inner planets have a few moons, but gas giants have a lot more moons.
The outer planets also all have rings.

## Dwarf planets
