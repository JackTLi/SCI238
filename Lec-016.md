## The sun's atmosphere

### Photosphere

Photosphere = "light sphere" - the apparent surface.

A "black" hot surface that radiates thermal protons - the source of the visible light from the sun.

Lowest and densest region of the sun's atmosphere:
	- Few hundred km thick
	- ~6000 K at the bottom
	- ~4000 K at the top

Below the photosphere, there are granules (convection) & sunspots (magnetism)

Sun is a thermal object, resulting in granules, and a magnetic object, resulting in sunspots.


##### Granulation
Sun is "boiling" : heated gases rises and radiates; cooled gas falls.

Granule diameter ~ 700-1200km
lifetime ~5-10 minutes

##### Sunspots
Regions of very strong magnetic fields -> disrupts convection of hotter material from below -> cooler/darker

Amount of thermal radiation at dark areas are much less as a result.

Pairs of sunspots are connected by dense magnetic field lines called "ropes"

The sun's plasma rotates more rapidly at the equator than at the poles. Plasma at the equator drags and twists magnetic field lines, and sunspots form where twisted lines break the surface.

__Sunspot cycle__ : ~11 years peak to peak

In beginning of sunspot cycle, they tend to happen further from the equator. Then, as the cycle progresses, they move closer to the equator. So the V gets steeper and steeper as the cycle progresses.

Polarity of sun's magnetic field flips with the same ~11 year cycle. -> 22 year cycle from N-S to S-N to N-S again.


#### Solar Prominences

Regions of trapped plasma can extend 10s of thousands of km above the photosphere.

### Chromosphere

Less dense (fainter) than the photosphere. The chromosphere can be seen in visible light during an eclipse.

## Corona

Coronal mass ejections - Ejections of over 10^12 kg at speeds of over 10^6 km/hr

## Pressure-gravity balance

Fast moving helium as a result of fusion creates a lot of outward pressure. Meanwhile, gravity is a huge inward force that holds it together. When there is no more fusion, a star will literally collapse in on itself due to its own gravity.

Ideal gas law: P = nkT

`n = # particles/volume = number density`

T => KE (speed) of particles
n => probability of collisions
 both are critical for fusion.
