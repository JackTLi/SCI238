# Earth's atmosphere

### Earth is illuminated and heated by the sun
(Solar system slide 48)

- Blue light scatters a lot => At edges there is red light, which is why sunsets are red.

----

Earth's atmosphere blocks some wavelengths, and transmits others.
It absorbs from the sun, and emits thermal radiation in all directions.

So `energy in` = `energy out`

----

### Greenhouse effect

We need greenhouse gases to trap some of the emitted thermal radiation, otherwise Earth will be very cold.

The gases work by absorbing and reemitting the thermal radiation which hits and warms the earth, and gets reemitted again.

### Escape of Atmosphere

Escape temperature depends on sqrt(T/m), so generally higher temperature => higher mass gases can escape.

Also, atmospheric gases with low gas can escape (helium, hydrogen)

### CO2 Cycle

Movement of subterranean rocks traps CO2 in under the surface of the earth in the form of carbonate rocks, and that gets released in volcanic explosions. This is important because if we didn't have this, we would not be alive.

If earth is too cool, there is less precipitation and CO2 goes up.
If earth is too hot,  there is more precipation and CO2 goes down
So, earth has its own regulatory procedure for dealing with the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

### Atmospheric Heating

Air is hottest at equator, and coolest at the poles. As air heats up at equator, it goes towards poles where it cools down, which causes it to go back to equator and cycle repeats.

But, earth rotates, which affects atmospheric circulation through something called the __Cariolis Effect__.

### Cariolis Effect

(See Solar System slide 62)

Cariolis Effect causes circulation cells to divide, so there are three cells per hemisphere.

The general flow gets deflected sideways, so it creates winds.
