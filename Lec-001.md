# Cosmic Mysteries

##### Where do we come from?
 - We are made of elements created throughout the solar system. E.g. hydrogen formed by big bang, and then other elements formed in stars through nuclear fusion
 - Water likely came from other parts of the solar system

##### Why are we here?
- Life is an inevitable consequence of thermodynamics

##### Origin of the universe

### Big idea: Gravity is universal
----
- Object (e.g. moon) orbit the earth because of earth's gravity pulling stuff down. Something going fast enough (8km/s) creates an orbit
- Objects orbit the sun because of the suns gravity, and the planets move fast enough to orbit around the sun.
- Gravity also affects suns in galaxies

**Perspective:** <br />
Earth is 0.1 _light seconds_. <br />
The solar system is _light hours_. <br />
Surrounding solarsystem is _light years_. <br />
Galaxy is _hundreds of thousands of light years_. <br />
Local Galactic Group is _millions of light years_. <br />
Virgo Supercluster is _100 million light years_. <br />
Local Superclusters are _billions of light years_. <br />

#### How big is the universe?
Limited by edge of observable universe.

**What is the universe made of?** <br />
Stars, gas, dust <br />
74% H - 24% He -  2% heavier elements

**What causes distortion in pictures of stars?** <br />
Gravity bends light

### Big Idea: The past is written in the sky
The further we look, the further we see back in time. At some point its so far back that it reaches the beginning of the universe

**Question: Evolution of the universe as a whole?** <br />
Clue: More distance galaxies appear redder <br />
Einstein found that space itself expands. Light (e.g. short blue wavelengths) is stretched, and pushes the light waves to the red part of the spectrum. So, the further away the galaxy is, the redder they appear. <br />
We can call this _redshift_

### Cosmic Mystery: Dark Energy
Dark Energy is responsible for the expansion of the galaxy.
This expansion of space due to dark energy is used to explain _redshift_

### Where does the universe come from?

The night sky shows us that the universe had a beginning. Since there are no gaps, there must be stars whose light has not reached us yet.

As we move out, we should find that the universe is dense and hot.
In the beginning of time, space was completely filled by matter and it was extremely dense and hot. However, there were small fluctuations.

At T0, the entire observable universe was in a space smaller than the nucleus of an atom. A piece of this universe expanded suddenly (called: inflation) and the small fluctuations formed the universe.
