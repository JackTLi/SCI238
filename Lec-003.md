#### Sun's position in the sky

At different times, the sun appears to have different stars behind it.
_Ecliptic_ = Sun's path against background stars due o Earth's motion around Sun.

We use declination and right ascension to pinpoint locations on the celestial sphere.

Tilt is equal to 23.5 degrees.

Since all planet orbit the sun in very nearly the same plane (plane of earth's orbit), their paths against the background stars also lie roughly along the ecliptic.

#### Seasons

Misconception that earth is closer to the sun in summer.
Real effect of seasons is the tilt of the Earth, and the incoming sunlight.

When perpendicular to the sun there's more sunlight that hits the earth = warms everything up. Otherwise, it hits the ground at an angle and doesn't warm enough, resulting in winter.

## Types of Day

__Sidereal day__: Earth's rotation relative to its stars
__Solar Day__: Wait until sun is between east and west, and time it until it is at the same position again.

Earth has to rotate 1 degrees more for a solar day than a sidereal day.
= 240 seconds / 4 minutes

So, a sidereal day is about 4 minutes shorter than a solar day.

##### Sun's apparent motion on the sky

Because of earth's tilt, the height of the sun appears to change throughout the year in a sinusoidal pattern.

__Obliquity__:
The sun's apparent eastward speed against the background is _fastest_ at the solstices  (June & December) and _slowest_ at the equinoxes (March & September)

If earth is not rotating around the sun, high noon to high noon (solar day) would be exactly 24 hours. But, since earth is rotating and the sun is "moving", the extra movement would result in longer days and shorter days.

__Eccentricity__:
Earth moves fastest in January (closest to sun) and slowest in July (furthest from sun)
Thus, the eastwardly movement speed against the background sky is thus fastest in January and slowest in July.

#### Variations in Length of Solar day

Accumulation of shorter solar days -> Sun gets _ahead_ of clocks

Adding up the two effects (obliquity and eccentricity) give the _equation of time_

## Types of Month

__Sidereal Month__:
Time for moon to orbit earth = 27.3 days. (Earth travels ~30 degrees around sun in that time)

__Synodic Month__:
Time for one cycle of lunar phases (new moon to new moon)
1/12 longer than a sidereal month.


#### Planetary periods

Planetary periods can be measured with respect to the stars (orbital, or sidereal period) or relative to the position of the sun (synodic period).

For example, venus's orbit is tilted with respect to the tilt of the earth. So, when it is above the sun, it is called _inferior conjunction_ and when it is below the sun, it is called _superior conjunction_. But, venus is never that far from the sun.

On rare occasions, an inner planet will be perfectly aligned with the sun during inferior conjunction, causing a __transit__ across the sun's surface

## The moon
Moon's orbit around the earth is elliptical (e = 0.0549)
Moon's axis of rotation is tilted 6.58 degrees to orbital plane.

#### Lunar Libration

By observing the librations of the moon, we can determine the elliptical orbit of the moon.

Libration in latitude is due to varying speed of moon around elliptical orbit.

Libration in longitude is due to 6.58 degree tilt of moon's rotation axis relative to its orbital plane.

#### Eclipses

__Lunar Eclipse__:
When earth passes through earth's shadow
 - can happen only at __full__ moon (but not at all full moons)

__Solar Eclipse___:
When the earth passes through the moon's shadow (sun disappears)
 - can happen only at __new__ moon (but not at all new moons)
